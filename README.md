#Hello there!

Thanks for the opportunity to work on this code challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the assignments!
I wasn't able to complete the third challenge. I was sure to leave as much as I could about my thought process. If there is a resource you can point me to that you think might aid me in solving this, I would love to give it another shot and resubmit it to you. I want to get this right!
###Be sure to check out my Notes file!

I would sincerely appreciate any feedback on my code you may have!

Hope you had a wonderful weekend and we can talk soon.

All the best,

Nick Block
