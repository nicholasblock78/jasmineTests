#Hello there!

This was a code challenge I submitted to a company in early January of 2017.

I wasn't able to complete the third challenge, but I'm planning on coming back to it after I spend some time learning more about some of 16-byte fundamentals. I was sure to leave as much as I could about my thought process.

I would sincerely appreciate any feedback on my code you may have!

Sincerely,
Nick Block
